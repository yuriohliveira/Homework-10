# Team Profile Generator

## A Node command-line interface that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML page that displays profiles for each person

This application was built with an existing code, working with object construction and tests. It prompts the user for all information needed and generates and html page on the output folder with all profiles constructed.

## Installation

To run and develop the code for yourself, you can use an IDE such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

In order to use this application as intended, you must have Node.js installed. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Step-by-step installation instructions can be found [here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows). 

You must also download Inquirer (for prompting the user) and Jest (for the test suite), which you can do by calling `npm init` and `npm install` from the command line. For more detailed information, check out the documentation for [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). 

## Usage
